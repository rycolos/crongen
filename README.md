## Background
The best first projects often come from personal need. I've been working in linux environments on and off for over a decade, yet I've somehow never internalized crontab. I use it just sparingly enough that I always forget how to write schedule expressions. Faced with multiple Raspberry Pi projects, I found myself back and forth between [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru) in my browser and multiple terminal windows for SSH. This grew to be a pain and I desired a mobile-friendly version. It just so happened I was also learning SwiftUI at the same time and looking for a first project. And here we are.
